      <h1>About me</h1>
      <div id="map"></div>
      <p> I grew up in <span onclick="changeCenter(40.821520, -73.955770)">Harlem, New York</span> 
      and I currently attend <span onclick="changeCenter(42.444759, -76.484306)"> Cornell University.</span>
      Almost all of my family immigrated from <span onclick="changeCenter(18.483402, -69.929611)">the Dominican Republic</span> to the Bronx. I would spend every weekend
      as a kid with family in <span onclick="changeCenter(40.825770, -73.852760)">Castle Hill</span>. Although I spent most of my summers in DR the first summer that 
      I never went away to visit family is when I did the Girls Who Code Program at the <span onclick="changeCenter(40.756989, -73.989708)">New York City Microsoft Office</span>.
      Girls Who Code made me feel like a career in tech was something that could be achieved for me and I will always be
      grateful for that experience!</p>
